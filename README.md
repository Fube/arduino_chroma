# Chroma

## It kinda works

### Parts Needed

-   Arduino (I used an UNO)
-   300Ω resistor x 3
-   1kΩ resistor x 2
-   Male-to-Female jumper wires x 4
-   Male-to-Male jumper wires x 10
-   RGB LED
-   Joystick
-   Breadboard

### General Info

When uploading, do not touch the Joystick, it'll mess up the color calculations. <br/>
[Here is the formula I used to calculate the colors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#HSV_to_RGB)<br/>
Huge thanks to [SachaAlex](https://github.com/SaschaAlex) for helping me figure out how the aforementioned formula works.
